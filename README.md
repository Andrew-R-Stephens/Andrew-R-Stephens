<b><em>P.E.T.</em></b> is a niche Android mobile application which has been built to supplement the needs of gamers who play the game <b><em>"Phasmophobia"</em></b>. [<em>"Phasmophobia"</em>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/) is a multiplayer co-op PC horror game developed by [<b><em>Kinetic Games</em></b>](https://kineticgames.co.uk/).

<em><b>P.E.T.</b></em> acts as an unofficial companion tool for <em>"Phasmophobia"</em>. It gives extra features to players, enabling them to play the game with more efficiency and enhanced immersion. In the past, P.E.T. had solved a number of issues that Phasmophobia had; And while those issues have arguably been reworked in the game, <em>P.E.T.</em> still expands these features far past what the game supplies its users.
